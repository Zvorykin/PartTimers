# PartTimers

This was real Node.js + Vue.js SPA successfully running on my previous job since 2017.
Is definitely has some architectural mistakes but it was done as it was done.

Now it was rewritten using Ruby on Rails and became simple pet project to improve RoR skills.

As usual

`bundle`

then

`yarn`



Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
